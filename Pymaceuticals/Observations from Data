Title: Observations from Module 5 Data
The entire data set has looked upon a set of mice which had many variables upon them including their ID, weight, sex, age, and drug regimen they have endured, along side a multitude of time points that observed the volume of their tumor in cubic milimeters.  Overall, the drug regimen which observed the most observable time points was Capomulin and Ramicane and the smallest of amount of time points were observed from Propriva.  There was almost an even split of male and female mice with about 50.4% of them being male and the remaining 49.65 being female.  The average tumor volume at the final observable time point for each mice was considered for each treatment and the ones with the lowest values are the ones who have been treated with Capomulin and Ramicane.  The regimen with the largest values and largest variability in average tumor volume at the final timepoint is Infubinol.  Overall, there is a decrease in tumor treatment for all groups.  However, one aspect to consider is the positive relationship between weight and average tumor volume at the end of the study.  Further studies or analysis would be needed to determine whether the difference in average tumor volume would be significant enough for an observed mouse relative to its own weight.
